    description: "The SEAT Tarraco is the Spanish brand's first large SUV, positioned above the compact Ateca and subcompact Arona in the lineup. Named after the ancient name for the Spanish city of Tarragona, the Tarraco is built on the Volkswagen Group's MQB-A2 platform shared with the Volkswagen Tiguan Allspace and Å koda Kodiaq. Measuring approximately 4.74 meters in length, the Tarraco offers seven seats as standard in most markets (with a five-seat configuration available in some regions), positioning it as SEAT's flagship family vehicle. The exterior design features sharp, angular styling consistent with SEAT's design language but with a more premium, sophisticated appearance befitting its flagship status. Engine options at launch included 1.5 TSI and 2.0 TSI gasoline engines and 2.0 TDI diesel variants with power outputs ranging from 150 to 190 horsepower. Transmission options include six-speed manual and seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic, with 4Drive all-wheel drive available on higher-powered variants. The interior combines SEAT's driver-focused design with premium materials and advanced technology, including a 10.25-inch Digital Cockpit instrument display and an 8-inch floating touchscreen for the infotainment system. A comprehensive suite of driver assistance systems includes adaptive cruise control, lane assist, traffic sign recognition, and emergency assist. In 2021, the range expanded to include a plug-in hybrid eHybrid variant combining a 1.4 TSI gasoline engine with an electric motor for a combined output of 245 horsepower and an electric-only range of approximately 30 miles. The Tarraco was designed to appeal to growing families seeking a versatile, technology-rich vehicle with a more dynamic driving experience than typically offered in the seven-seat SUV segment. The Tarraco represents SEAT's move upmarket, competing with established seven-seat SUVs while offering distinctive styling and a more engaging driving experience than many rivals, consistent with SEAT's sportier positioning within the Volkswagen Group."
